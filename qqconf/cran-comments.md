## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There is one NOTE, which is that the DOI for the JSS manuscript does not exist.
This is expected, as mentioned in the DESCRIPTION.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of qqconf, all packages passed
